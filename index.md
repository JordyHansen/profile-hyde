I'm a member of the University of Iowa [School of Journalism and Mass Communication](http://clas.uiowa.edu/sjmc/) Class of 2016. 

I have proven expertise in [multimedia storytelling](/), [journalistic reporting and writing](/#) and [media law](/#). I am currently the sergeant-at-arms of the University of Iowa [Society for the Promotion of Associations](/#), and I really like green eggs and ham.
