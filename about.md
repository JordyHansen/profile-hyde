<p>If you've managed to find this page, you must be fairly interested in talking to me, so don't hesitate to shoot me an email or a text. I grew up in Marion, Iowa, which is more or less a suburb of Cedar Rapids (though don't tell people from Chicago that, they believe the only suburbs in the world are those outside of Chicago) and graduated from Marion High School in 2012. From there, it was an incredibly easy decision to come to the Unversity of Iowa.</p> 
<p>Upon coming to Iowa, my first thought was to join the local college newspaper <i>The Daily Iowan</i> which has had the strongest impact on me of any decision I've made to this point in time. I've lost count of the number of articles I've wrote (last I checked it was somewhere past 600 pieces of posted content) and it's made me into a much better writer, person, and — most importantly in this context — journalist. I've learned how to tell a story effectively, capture important moments on video, and a whole host of other things, including managing a staff. There's certainly been struggles, but I feel I'm currently in a good place, something I'm eternally grateful for.</p>
<p> If you're curious about my work, some of my favorite pieces I've wrote: <a href="http://www.dailyiowan.com/2015/05/06/Sports/42076.html">An Artist Inside</a>, <a href="http://daily-iowan.com/2015/09/21/raising-koehn/">Raising Koehn</a>, and <a href="http://daily-iowan.com/2016/04/08/iowa-the-hawkeye-wrestling-club-and-the-quest-for-gold/">The Quest for Gold</a>


The Quest for Gold</a>. 
<p>Personally, I have a loving girlfriend, wonderful parents, and two awesome younger brothers.
